Ultimate-Altimeter
==================

The Arduino sketch for the Ultimate Altimeter

See the Instructable [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Ultimate-Altimeter-A-compact-Arduino-altimeter/)!

==================
Libraries used:

~~[MPL3115A2 library](https://github.com/sparkfun/MPL3115A2_Breakout/tree/master/library)~~

~~[Seven Segment](https://github.com/sparkfun/SevSeg/tree/master/Libraries/)~~

~~[Bounce library](https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce-Arduino-Wiring/tree/master/Bounce2/)~~

These libraries are now included in the Libraries directory of this repo. They're so old that no one could find them. I dug them up from my computer and put them here for you. If someone wants to rewrite the code to use libraries that are online and supported, I'll gladly accept a PR!
